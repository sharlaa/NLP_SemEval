## Laptop and Restaurant Datasets

Both datasets are constructed by annotating valence and arousal (VA) values on the [ACOS dataset (Cai et al., 2021)](https://github.com/NUSTM/ACOS). Participants can use these datasets for model training across all subtasks (DimASR, DimASTE, DimASQP) based on different combinations of the annotated elements.  

Note: The training sets retain implicit aspects/opinions with NULL annotations from the original ACOS dataset. However, the test set to be released on December 1 will not include such implicit NULL annotations.
